## SYNOPSIS
`update-torbrowser` [option(s)]

## DESCRIPTION
Lets you safely download the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)
from The Tor Project's (TPO) website. It enforces TLS encryption (https) for
TPO's website, downloads TBB from the TPO's website,
and uses OpenPGP verification.

In case there is already a `~/.tb/tor-browser` folder, it renames it
to ~/.tb/tor-browser_(current date and time). It extracts freshly
downloaded TBB too to `~/.tb/tor-browser`.

Default action when no options are given is to performs an update check and ask
how you want to proceed.

## OPTIONS
  * --onion

    Download from Tor Project's onion rather than clearnet domain.

  * --ordinary

    Uses curl's ordinary progress bar. Only affects run in terminal. When using
    this option, the GUI progress bar will be stuck but downloading will still
    work. Note, when using this option, it wouldn't notice if the download
    server were to run an endless data attack, for example the server claiming
    to provide a 500.000 GB big file. (It does not use
    `/usr/lib/curl-scripts/curl-prgrs`s `CURL_PRGRS_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`.)
    However, it can be compensated by either manually terminating
    `update-torbrowser` or by using the timeout utility as in the example
    below.

  * --noask

    Installs whatever https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/RecommendedTBBVersions
    claims to be the lowest version without user interaction.

  * --nokilltb

    Advanced users only. Do not kill all eventually still running instances of
    Tor Browser. Useful in case you want to update
    `~/.tb/tor-browser`, while still using
    `~/tor-browser_something_else`.

  * --language lang

    Specify which language specific version of Tor Browser you want to start or
    update.

  * --no-tor-con-check

    Skip Tor bootstrap connectivity check. (Only relevant in anonymity
    distributions.)

  * --input input

    What to use as input method. When run in command line, by default, standard
    input (stdin) will be used. When using --input gui, questions would be
    asked in the graphical user environment.

  * --resume

    Resume previous download.

changes or when upstream makes other changes to the start process or proxy
settings detection method.

In this case, Whonix developers will try to provide a fix as fast as possible.
Please check Whonix News Blogs, Whonix Forum for a fix or workaround.
